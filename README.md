### Challenges

- One of the challenges I faced was finding out how to fetch the IGDB Api correctly, which included using axios interceptors to keep the token updated, Next.js rewrites to avoid proxy issues and writing custom functions to create body for requests.
- Another challenge was to handle the data from IGDB Api, which was not always consistent and required a lot of data manipulation.
- It was also challenging to handle the cache correctly, when and how to invalidate it, how to use it with realtime chat and how to use it with IGDB Api.
- Lastly, it was challenging to implement the realtime chat, which required a lot of research and testing.

<p align="right">(<a href="#gamehub">back to top</a>)</p>

### Future Plans

In the future I plan to:

- Write tests with probably playwright
- Add an abiliity to write game reviews
- It would be nice to be able to import your games from Steam, although I am not sure if it is possible

<p align="right">(<a href="#gamehub">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Running the app

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/v-mokhun/gamehub.git .
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the app (Will not work without environment variables)
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

1. Create a .env file in the root of the project and copy all contents from .env.example file.
2. Register on [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) and create a new application, then grab your publishable key and secret key. Then go to webhooks and grab your webhook secret. For local testing you can use ngrok to create a tunnel to your localhost. Important: make sure to add your ngrok url to the webhook url in Clerk.
3. In [Clerk Dashboard](dashboard.clerk.dev) go to Users & Authentication -> Social Connections and enable Google, GitHub and Twitch. Here is an detailed [guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth) on how to do it.
4. Register on [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and create a new application, then grab your client id and client secret and as OAuth Redirect URLs insert your Clerk OAuth Callback.
5. Register on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) and create a new database, then grab your database url by clicking on Connect button.
6. Register on [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) and create a new channel, then grab your app id, key, secret and cluster.
7. Lastly, register on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and grab your cloud name. Furthermore, you will need to create a new preset and make it unsigned and also put its name in .env file. You can also use your own image hosting service, just make sure to change the code accordingly.
